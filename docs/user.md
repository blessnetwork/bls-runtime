# How to Use `bls-runtime`

## Install binary

1. Clone the repository and build the runtime using Cargo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/bls-runtime.git
cd bls-runtime
cargo build --release
```
This will generate the bls-runtime binary in the target/release/ directory.

2. Download binary release from the repository

```bash
sh -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blessnetwork/bls-runtime/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash"
```
**Note: Please select the appropriate version based on your operating system and CPU architecture.**

Try to execute binary

```bash
bls-runtime --help
```

```

## How to build the wasm

### Download the bls-javy

```bash
sh -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blocklessnetwork/bls-javy/main/download.sh | bash"
```

### Write and execute hello world

Save code to the hello.js file
```javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("hello World")
}
helloWorld()
```

Build the code to wasm

```bash
bls-javy build hello.js -o hello.wasm
```

Run the wasm with runtime

```bash
bls-runtime  hello.wasm
```

### Use `--limited-fuel` option

Use option `--limited-fuel` to limit the instructions the app can execute.

```bash
bls-runtime --limited-fuel=1000  hello.wasm
```

After excute the wasm, you will get the `1` as the app execute code, and in the log file `hello.log` you will get the message "[2025-05-09T03:23:32Z ERROR blockless] All fuel is consumed, the app exited, fuel consumed 0, Max Fuel is 1000."

### Use `--dir` or `--fs-root-path` option

The runtime is a great sandbox â€” by default, it cannot access the local file system unless explicitly configured. To enable local file system access, you need to map it using the `--fs-root-path` and `--dir` options.

use follow command to build wasm file

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/template-rust-wasi.git
cd template-rust-wasi
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
```

then mkdir root directory as the file system
```bash
mkdir root_dir
```

If you don't map the required path, running the WASM app will result in a crash.

```bash
bls-runtime target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm
```
```
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:10:10:
Failed to open file: Custom { kind: Uncategorized, error: "failed to find a pre-opened file descriptor through which \"output.txt\" could be opened" }
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```


The correct approach is to run the following command.

```bash
bls-runtime --dir=`pwd`/root_dir::/ target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm
```
```--dir=`pwd`/root_dir::/``` mean map host dir `pwd`/root_dir to /

### Use `--max-memory-size` option 

Set the runtime memory limits to restrict the app's maximum memory usage. By default, there are no limits.

```
git clone -b memory_limited https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/template-rust-wasi.git
cd template-rust-wasi
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
bls-runtime --max-memory-size=1024 target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm
```

![](images/memory_limited.jpg)


### Use `--env` option

In some scenarios, we use environment variables within a WASM app. By default, no environment variables are available, but they can be passed in using the `--env` option.


```bash
git clone -b environment https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/template-rust-wasi.git
cd template-rust-wasi
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
bls-runtime --env=LANG=en_AU.UTF-8 --env=HOME=/home/ target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm
```

### The permssion options
The runtime access to most system I/O is denied by default. If there are some I/O operations that are allowed in a limited capacity, even by default. 
To enable the operations, the user must  grant permission to the bls-runtime. Follow options is valid for security of bls-runtime `--allow-read`, `--allow-write`, `--allow-net`.

When execute the wasm app, use can explicitly grant permission to specify files, directories and network.

Users can also explicitly disallow access to specific resources by using the `--deny-read`, `--deny-write`, `--deny-net` flags

`--allow-all` flag that grants all permissions to wasm app

```bash
git clone -b permssions/read https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/template-rust-wasi.git
cd template-rust-wasi
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
mkdir root_fs -p
echo "hello world">root_fs/input.txt

bls-runtime --allow-all --dir=root_fs::/ target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm
```

#### File system access 

The wasm app can't access read and write arbitrary files on the file system, even you map the host dir to wasm app use option `--dir` This includes listing the contents of directories.

Access to read files is granted using the `--allow-read` option and access to write files is granted using the `--allow-write` option. These flags can be specified with a list of paths to allow access to specific files or directories and any subdirectories in them.

Definition:`--allow-read[=<PATH>...]`

```bash
git clone -b permssions/read https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/template-rust-wasi.git
cd template-rust-wasi
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
mkdir root_fs -p
echo "hello world">root_fs/input.txt

# Allow all reads to file system
bls-runtime --allow-read --dir=root_fs::/ target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm

# Allow all read input.txt output.txt only to file system
bls-runtime --allow-read=input.txt,output.txt --dir=root_fs::/ target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm
```

![alt text](images/file_read.jpg)


Definition:`--allow-write[=<PATH>...]`
```bash
git clone -b permssions/write https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/template-rust-wasi.git
cd template-rust-wasi
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
mkdir root_fs -p

# Allow all writes to file system
bls-runtime --allow-write --dir=root_fs::/ target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm

# Allow  write files to /
bls-runtime --allow-write=/ --dir=root_fs::/ target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm

cat root_fs/output.txt
```


### Network access
Execute wasm app can not make network requests. Network access is granted using the `--allow-net` option. This option can be specified with a list of IP addresses or hostnames to allow access to specific network addresses.

Definition: `--allow-net[=<IP_OR_HOSTNAME>...]`

Definition:`--allow-net[=<PATH>...]`
```bash
git clone -b permssions/http https://github.com/blocklessnetwork/template-rust-wasi.git
cd template-rust-wasi
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
mkdir root_fs -p

# Allow network access
bls-runtime --allow-net --dir=root_fs::/ target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm

# Allow network access to httpbin.org
bls-runtime --allow-net=httpbin.org target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-world.wasm

cat root_fs/output.txt
```
